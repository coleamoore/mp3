Question 1:
The 11 lines of code are repeated in the getAvailables() and getUpdates() 
methods which means this code smell is duplicate code. We used the Extract 
Method form of refactoring to create a method that performs these 11 lines
rather than having them repeat in different methods.

Question 2:
Check github for commit q2.

Question 3:
The updateAndTrim() method doesn't seem to belong in the Nodes class since the 
the code in the method only calls from the jenkins.model package. It should be 
moved to the jenkins.model.Jenkins class. This is an example of feature envy code
smells and it can be corrected with move refactoring.

Question 4:
Since the code uses only an iterator, we used a while loop (but could have used a
for loop) to repeat the statements. The code smell is duplicate code.

Question 5:
The code smell was duplicate code. Check github for commit q5

Question 6:
Using the tool we were able to find about 10 duplicate lines of code in HudsonTestCase
and JenkinsRule files. We used the extract method to refactor the code.
